 - Combinational Circuit For Register
This is the combinational logic circuit for register designed by Rehoboam Rock on Logisim. The register is to be connected with the ALU and accumulator (as shown in the main circuit of the microprocessor). The circuitry was then converted into the form of an IC to minimize the space occupied by it, and the final register combinational circuit is also shown as an IC that is connected with the ALU in the main circuit of the 4-bitÂ microprocessor.
