 - Combinational Circuit For Register
 - This is the combinational logic circuit for register designed by Rehoboam Rock on Logisim. The register is to be connected with the ALU and accumulator (as shown in the main circuit of the microprocessor). The circuitry was then converted into the form of an IC to minimize the space occupied by it, and the final register combinational circuit is also shown as an IC that is connected with the ALU in the main circuit of the 4-bitÂ microprocessor.

 - A register combined with the ALU is a digital circuit that can store data and perform arithmetic and logical operations on that data. It consists of two main components:

 - Register: The register is a digital circuit that can store a fixed number of bits of data. It can hold data temporarily for processing or store data for long-term storage.

 - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU is a digital circuit that can perform arithmetic and logical operations on binary data. It can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shifts.

 - When a register is combined with an ALU, the register is used to hold the data that is being processed by the ALU. The ALU is then used to perform operations on the data stored in the register. For example, the ALU can perform an addition operation on the data stored in the register, and the result is stored back into the same register.

 - Registers combined with ALUs are commonly used in digital systems such as microprocessors and CPUs. They enable fast processing of data and are essential components of modern computing systems. The combination of a register and an ALU can be used for a wide range of applications, including digital signal processing, image processing, and scientific computing.
