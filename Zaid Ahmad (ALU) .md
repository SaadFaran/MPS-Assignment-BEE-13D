This is the ALU logic circuit designed by Zaid Ahmad on Logisim. The ALU is to be connected with the accumulator, input, and output registers (as shown in the main circuit of the microprocessor). The circuitry was then converted into the form of an IC to minimize the space occupied by it, and the final ALU is also shown as an IC that is connected with the accumulator and registers in the main circuit of the 4-bitÂ microprocessor.
